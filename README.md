# Call Centre Customer Service Analysis

Customer service quality can make or break a company’s reputation. Call-centres are often at the frontline of customer interactions, making them a crucial component of customer satisfaction strategies.

To ensure that these interactions meet customer expectations, it’s essential to analyse and understand the factors that contribute to positive or negative experiences.

In this project, we delve into a dataset from a call centre and explore key metrics and uncover insights that can help improve call centre operations and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction.

## Background of the Call-Centre Dataset

This dataset originates from a call centre, focusing on customer interactions and feedback.

The data includes various attributes related to customer service experiences, such as customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores, sentiment analysis of the interactions, call details, and response times.

The primary purpose of this dataset is to assess the performance of the call centre and the quality of customer service.
